# DECISION TREE

This project builds a Decision Tree model to classify data using the Scikit-learn library.


## Features

Apply Decision Tree to solve data classification problem.
Use Scikit-learn to build and evaluate Decision Tree models.

## Tech Stack

- Language: Python

- Library: Scikit learn
 

## Work Flow

**Preparing the data sets:**
 - Merge two file poker-hand-training-true.data and poker-hand-testing.data
 - Shuffle the data
 - Create label and feature for data
 - Visualize the distributions of classes in all the data sets

**Building the decision tree classifiers**

**Evaluating the decision tree classifiers:**
 - Decision Tree Classifier Report and Confusion Matrix for each train rate
